This project aims to develop a machine learning-based system to predict patient readmission. The system will analyze patient demographics, medical history, previous admissions, and treatment details to determine the likelihood of readmission. By leveraging data analytics, hospitals can take preventive measures to reduce unnecessary readmissions, enhance patient care, and manage resources efficiently. The model will be trained on healthcare datasets and validated for accuracy and reliability.
